# Image-Cation-generation
image captioning model using a CNN-RNN architecture with TensorFlow, incorporating an attention mechanism to enhance caption accuracy. The model processes images and generates descriptive captions by tokenizing text data and creating sequences for training. The project also includes data preprocessing
