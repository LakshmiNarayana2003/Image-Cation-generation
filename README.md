# Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention

This project focuses on developing an image captioning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with an attention mechanism. The model is designed to generate descriptive captions for images by effectively combining visual and textual data.

## Features

- **CNN-RNN Architecture**: Leverages CNNs for image feature extraction and RNNs for sequential text generation.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Enhances the model's ability to focus on different parts of an image while generating captions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes tokenizing captions, adding start/end tokens, and creating sequences for training.
- **Training**: The model is trained on a dataset of images and corresponding captions to predict captions for new images.

## Installation
